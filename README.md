# PHASE ONE PROJECT_AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT ANALYSIS


## Business Understanding/Overview
I am charged with determining which aircrafts have the lowest risk for the company to start a new
business since it is trying to expand and diversify its portfolio. They are interested in purchasing
and operating airplanes for both commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything
about the potential risks of aircraft. My aim is to assist look at the data, analyse then translate my
findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide
which aircraft to purchase

## Problem Statement
The company wants to get into new industries and explore aircrafts for commercial and private
purposes and it requires assessment form the data to identify low-risk aircraft.
The goal is to recommend low risk aircraft that are suitable for successful market entry. Actionable insights will
guide the aviation division in making informed purchasing decisions.

## Objective
1. Analyze past data to identify accident trends over time and determine whether accident rates
are improving or worsening
2. Identify and compare accident rates versus aircraft model to find the ones with the lowest
accident rate and the safest
3. Look at the location with most accidents to identify regions or routes with higher risk which
will help in planning and strategic deployment of the aircraft.

## Success Criteria
1. The project will be successful if we are able to identify how viable it is to get into the aircraft
business through the analysis made
2. If we are able to deliver clear and analysed accident rates created by specific aircrafts to
identify the one with the lowest risk
3. When we are able to identify the suitable location for aircraft deployment

## Limitations and Assumptions
• Due to missing and incomplete data, we may not get the true picture of the recommendations
that would be made
• We only have Accidents data and that may not be conclusive in determining whether an
aircraft is viable, durable and cost efficient. Safety of the aircraft alone might not be sufficient

## Data Understanding
The NTSB aviation accident database contains information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the United States, its territories and possessions, and in international waters.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
After cleaning  the dataset, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data better and extract actionable insights. Below is a summary of the EDA process:

Up until 1980, the number of accidents remained stable, showing little to no change. 
This could suggest that either accidents were not being recorded or that there were fewer airlines in operation during that time. 
An unusual event happened in 1980 which caused a spike but the accident rates started improving significantly
